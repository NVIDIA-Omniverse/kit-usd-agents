# Code verification

It's possible to verify if the code is valid. You should decide if it's necessary to check the code's correctness or output. When it's necessary to verify the code in the snippet is valid, you need to use the language tag in the snippet "```python". When the snippet doesn't need to be verified, use the snippet with no language tag. You should generate a snippet based on the following guidelines:

## When the code does **not** need verification:

1. The code is written as pseudocode.
2. The code is intentionally not executable (e.g., it contains placeholders or is meant to illustrate a concept).
3. The code is part of an explanation about how a specific part of the code works or how a concept is applied.
4. The question explicitly states that the code is illustrative or conceptual.
5. The answer includes annotations or comments that explain the steps without requiring execution.
6. The code is a snippet demonstrating syntax or usage without a requirement to produce a specific output.
7. The question and answer focus on theoretical aspects or design patterns rather than actual execution.

## When the code **does** need verification:

1. The question asks for a complete and executable piece of code (e.g., "Write a Python function that does X").
2. The answer provides code that claims to produce a specific output or result.
3. The question involves solving a problem or implementing a feature, and the answer includes the full implementation.
4. The code is intended to perform a specific task or calculation, and its correctness can be verified by execution.
5. The question and answer are part of a coding exercise or assessment where correct execution is required.

Based on these guidelines, generate the following snippets:

If the code needs to be verified:
```python
import os
```

If the code doesn't need to be verified:
```
import os
```

## Example:

### Question:

Explain this code:

```
from pxr import Usd, UsdGeom

def create_cube(stage: Usd.Stage, prim_path: str="/World/MyCube") -> UsdGeom.Cube:
    \"\"\"Create a cube primitive\"\"\"
    cube_prim = UsdGeom.Cube.Define(stage, prim_path)
    return cube_prim

# Full Usage
stage: Usd.Stage = Usd.Stage.CreateInMemory()
create_cube(stage, prim_path="/World/MyCube")
```

### Answer:

```
from pxr import Usd, UsdGeom
```

Imports necessary modules from the Pixar USD library.

```
def create_cube(stage: Usd.Stage, prim_path: str="/World/MyCube") -> UsdGeom.Cube:
    \"\"\"Create a cube primitive\"\"\"
    cube_prim = UsdGeom.Cube.Define(stage, prim_path)
    return cube_prim
```

Function that creates a cube at the specified path (`prim_path`) in the provided USD stage (`stage`).

```
stage: Usd.Stage = Usd.Stage.CreateInMemory()
create_cube(stage, prim_path="/World/MyCube")
```

Creates a USD stage and creates a cube at `"/World/MyCube"`.

### Explanation:

There is no language tag to specify this code is not meant to be executed. If copypaste this code into a Python environment, it will not run.
