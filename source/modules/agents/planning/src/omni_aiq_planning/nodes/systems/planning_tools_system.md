## Available Tools

You can use these tools in your plan:

<tools>

### Important Rules:
- Use tool names directly in your plan steps
- Each step should use exactly ONE tool
- If you need multiple tools, create separate steps for each tool
- Be specific about which tool to use for each action

### Examples:
- Good: "Step 1: Use FileSearch to find all Python files"
- Good: "Step 2: Use ReadFile to examine the main.py file"

- Bad: "Step 1: Search for files and read their contents"
- Bad: "Step 1: Analyze the codebase" (too vague - specify which tool)

### Planning Tips:
- Look at the tool descriptions to understand what each tool can do
- Match your steps to the available tools
- Break complex tasks into multiple steps if needed
